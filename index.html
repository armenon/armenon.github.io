                  <li>Baby Location is an iOS application that interfaces with an Internet of Things (IoT) based

                    <span class="bullet-head">Why was this needed?</span>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The District Health Board of Manukau County wanted to increase the security at the hospitals
                        under their jurisdiction. They wanted to harness the power of the Internet of Things to see if
                        they could install a future proof system that could ultimately be used to improve their overall
                        security system. To this end, they called out to many companies to test their solutions as a
                        proof of concept at one of the biggest hospitals under their care - Middlemore Hospital.

                    <ul>
                      <li>Complete Medical Solutions and WiSilica undertook a month long pilot study at Middlemore
                        Hospital, Auckland in order to test and prove the effectiveness of their solution. The pilot
                        study involved using a prototype application that I designed.

                      </li>

                      <li> The prototype application evolved into one of the first versions of the tracking applications
                        used by WiSilica.

                    <span class="bullet-head">The Issues </span>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The primary users of this system were the nurses at the respective hospitals, the system was
                        planned to be installed. However, due to their busy schedules the overhead introduced by the new
                        system would have been an additional burden for them.The first version had flows that were too
                        long winded and complicated for them to use. So the system had to be redesigned to be quick and
                        simple to use.

                      </li>

                      <li>The administrators of the system also needed an interface to install, configure and monitor
                        the system, which required a more technical interface. Thus the interface had a dichotomy
                        between having to be simple and having to be technical

                      </li>

                      <li>One of the main complaints that the nurses had during the pilot study was that system was too
                        technically challenging to use. The nurses were people who were just about comfortable with
                        smartphones but not more. The flow had to be redesigned so that the system did most of the heavy
                        lifting and was also ‘technically simple’ to use

                      <li>While brainstorming for ideas, we touched upon the topic of how difficult it was to choose things to watch on Netflix when a person was with friends or family and found that it was a common problem. We decided to investigate this further.

                      <li>From research and surveys, we were able to determine that 85% of people who used video streaming services, regularly watched it with a another person, with 48% doing so at least once a week.

                      <li> We also found that people spent 18 MINUTES on an average just deciding on what to watch.

                      <li> Another insight was that more people were now using smart tvs to watch Netflix as opposed to smartphones and laptops

                  <li>Colour is one of most important properties relating to vision. It is a preattentive feature 
                    that is processed at the retina itself. In the context of IT, colour is pervasive in almost 
                    everything. This project aims to identify the impacts of colour in the context of IT by using
                     simple web-based and mobile application based memory games.

                         However, we did notice that other factors of UI elements such as position and size had an
                          effect on memory and perception

                        usability study. We found that the participants themselves get flustered when the voice assistants
                        fail to perform the required task and when repeating the task, participants tend phrase the request
                         differently.

                    <ul>

                      <li> - From our study, we had to conclude that while voice based interfaces have come a long
                         way in terms of capability and accessibility, they are still not fully ready to be used for
                          everyday tasks.
                      </li>

                      <li> - We were also able to conclude that while Siri has an overall slight edge over Google 
                        assistant in this study, it was not statistically significant.
                      </li>

                      <li> - However, we did find a statistical significance in Google assistant’s ability
                         to accurately understand speech over Siri.
                      </li>

                      <li> - But Siri was able to infer context better, though there was no statistical significance 
                        for the conclusion.

                  <li>Augmented Reality provides an additional layer for designers to manipulate in order to add

                    accessible than ever. This project explores how AR and sounds can be used to enhance and improve 
                    comprehension using a tabletop game called ‘Munchkin’ as a proof of concept.

                    <ul>
                      <li>Information is most useful when provided in the right context. As mentioned before, 
                        new technologies such as Augmented Reality provides an additional interface for designers
                         to add a new layer of interactivity to a product. However, a lot of the applications 
                         currently using AR choose to make the AR interface the primary interface for interacting 
                         with the product, which robs users of the benefits they get when interacting with the 
                         objects in real-time space. We wanted to challenge this screen based thinking by exploring
                          how AR can be used instead as a secondary support interface so as enhance comprehension. 
                      </li>

                      <li>‘Munchkin’ is a tabletop card game that has a LOT of rules that need to be understood 
                        both before and while playing the game. We wanted the AR and sonification interface to 
                        essentially replace the rulebook and allow player to jump right and learn as they play.
                        </li>

                    This wearable jacket, intended for the elderly, for hosptial patients, etc is designed to detect if 
                    the user falls down and alerts people to the same. It also contains a muscular pain relief electo-stimulator
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The jacket contains an integrated fall detection sensor (using an accelerometer) that is connected
                    to a GSM module capable of sending a text message to emergency contacts. The jackt also contains a integrated
                    electronic muscle stimulator, that when activated, passes a small electric current through the arm muscles that 
                    is capable of muscular pain relief.

                      <li>
                      I was invovled in all aspects of creation, from designing the actual product to creating the electronic
                      circuits and programming the system.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li class="pro-list">

                    <span class="bullet-head">Why was this needed?</span>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Elderly citizens and hospital patients who fall down are sometimes unable to  get the immediate assistance that
                      they require. Lack of timely assistance can exacerbate the problem and even lead to the patient's demise. The jacket is designed
                      to help caregivers and relatives of such people by providing them with timely notifications of fall events. 
                    
                      Additionally, people who suffer from muscular cramps, tend to benefit from the pain relief provided by eletrical muscle 
                      stimulation. This jacket tries to incorporate a miniature version of the same.</li>
                     <li>
                      The jacket is also intended for patients with muscular degenerative diseases such as Motor Neuron
                      Disease (MND), which in addition to causing the patient to gradually lose control of their volutary motions,
                      also causes loss muscle tone due to lack of use. Therefore, a caretaker has to regulary move the limbs of
                      the patient to prevent this. The integrated muscular stimulator can prevent this loss of muscle tone, saving the 
                      caretaker from manually having to move the patient's limbs and the fall detection can be used to detect if the
                      patient has fallen from their chair or bed, especially at night, since the patient gradually becomes unable to speak

                <li>Jag heter Arjun… I’m Arjun, an  aspiring jack of all trades. My passion lies in creating things. 
                  I prefer to have a very diverse set of skills as opposed to mastering in just one. Having done my 
                  undergraduate studies in ‘Electronics and Biomedical Engineering’, I am very much at home on both
                   breadboards and printed circuit boards as well as Image reconstruction using Radon transforms
                    (although I may have forgotten that… It was a long time ago).
                </li>

                <li>I have worked across variety of domains from interning as a biomedical engineer to dipping my 
                  toes in digital marketing (my first job); and later worked as a mobile application developer and 
                  also a designer. I began programming when I was young (well, I knew how run command line inputs to
                   fire up Prince or Persia and Dave when I was 4.. but I digress..)
                  </li>


                <li>I’m currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Interactive Media Technology at KTH Royal Institute
                   of Technology, Stockholm whilst also working part time. I believe that pursuing design is the 
                   natural progression aligns best with my interests and would round off my skill set to provide a 
                   holistic overview on almost every aspect in the creation of a product.
