</span>
                      <ul><li>I was involved in both designing and developing the interface for the application and the overall user experience including how users interacted with various technical artefacts in the system.

                      <span class="bullet-head">Why was this needed?</span>
                      <ul><li>The District Health Board of Manukau County wanted to increase the security at the hospitals under their jurisdiction. They wanted to harness the power of the Internet of Things to see if they could install a future proof system that could ultimately be used to improve their overall security system. To this end, they called out to many companies to test their solutions as a proof of concept at one of the biggest  hospitals under their care - Middlemore Hospital.

                      <span class="bullet-head">The Pilot Study</span>
                      <ul><li>Complete Medical Solutions and WiSilica undertook a month long pilot study at Middlemore Hospital, Auckland in order to test and prove the effectiveness of their solution. The pilot study involved using a prototype application that I designed. 

                      </li>

                       <li> The prototype application evolved into one of the first versions of the tracking applications used by WiSilica.

                      </li>

                      <span class="bullet-head">The Issues </span>
                      <ul><li>The primary users of this system were the nurses at the respective hospitals, the system was planned to be installed. However, due to their busy schedules the overhead introduced by the new system would have been an additional burden for them.The first version had flows that were too long winded and complicated for them to use. So the system had to be redesigned to be quick and simple to use.

                      </li>

                    <li>The administrators of the system also needed an interface to install, configure and monitor the system, which required a more technical interface. Thus the interface had a dichotomy between having to be simple and having to be technical

                      </li>

                    <li>One of the main complaints that the nurses had during the pilot study was that system was too technically challenging to use. The nurses were people who were just about comfortable with smartphones but not more. The flow had to be redesigned so that the system did most of the heavy lifting and was also ‘technically simple’ to use

                      <span class="bullet-head">Why was this needed?</span>
                      <ul><li>The District Health Board of Manukau County wanted to increase the security at the hospitals under their jurisdiction. They wanted to harness the power of the Internet of Things to see if they could install a future proof system that could ultimately be used to improve their overall security system. To this end, they called out to many companies to test their solutions as a proof of concept at one of the biggest  hospitals under their care - Middlemore Hospital.

                      <ul><li>Complete Medical Solutions and WiSilica undertook a month long pilot study at Middlemore Hospital, Auckland in order to test and prove the effectiveness of their solution. The pilot study involved using a prototype application that I designed. 

                      </li>

                       <li> The prototype application evolved into one of the first versions of the tracking applications used by WiSilica.

                      <span class="bullet-head">The Issues </span>
                      <ul><li>The primary users of this system were the nurses at the respective hospitals, the system was planned to be installed. However, due to their busy schedules the overhead introduced by the new system would have been an additional burden for them.The first version had flows that were too long winded and complicated for them to use. So the system had to be redesigned to be quick and simple to use.

                      </li>

                    <li>The administrators of the system also needed an interface to install, configure and monitor the system, which required a more technical interface. Thus the interface had a dichotomy between having to be simple and having to be technical

                      </li>

                    <li>One of the main complaints that the nurses had during the pilot study was that system was too technically challenging to use. The nurses were people who were just about comfortable with smartphones but not more. The flow had to be redesigned so that the system did most of the heavy lifting and was also ‘technically simple’ to use

                      <span class="bullet-head">Why was this needed?</span>
                      <ul><li>The District Health Board of Manukau County wanted to increase the security at the hospitals under their jurisdiction. They wanted to harness the power of the Internet of Things to see if they could install a future proof system that could ultimately be used to improve their overall security system. To this end, they called out to many companies to test their solutions as a proof of concept at one of the biggest  hospitals under their care - Middlemore Hospital.

                      <ul><li>Complete Medical Solutions and WiSilica undertook a month long pilot study at Middlemore Hospital, Auckland in order to test and prove the effectiveness of their solution. The pilot study involved using a prototype application that I designed. 

                      </li>

                       <li> The prototype application evolved into one of the first versions of the tracking applications used by WiSilica.

                      <span class="bullet-head">The Issues </span>
                      <ul><li>The primary users of this system were the nurses at the respective hospitals, the system was planned to be installed. However, due to their busy schedules the overhead introduced by the new system would have been an additional burden for them.The first version had flows that were too long winded and complicated for them to use. So the system had to be redesigned to be quick and simple to use.

                      </li>

                    <li>The administrators of the system also needed an interface to install, configure and monitor the system, which required a more technical interface. Thus the interface had a dichotomy between having to be simple and having to be technical

                      </li>

                    <li>One of the main complaints that the nurses had during the pilot study was that system was too technically challenging to use. The nurses were people who were just about comfortable with smartphones but not more. The flow had to be redesigned so that the system did most of the heavy lifting and was also ‘technically simple’ to use
